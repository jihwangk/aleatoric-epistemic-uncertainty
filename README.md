# PyTorch Implementation of Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty

This repository is not the official repository for the paper, ["What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision". NIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04977), but an implementation of the uncertainties as classification loss functions with CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100.  

## How to Run

Git clone or download the uncertainty.ipynb file and upload it to your Google Drive. Open the file with Google Colaboratory to see the file in correct format. Simply follow the instructions and run cells afterward.

## Notes

In current version, only epistemic uncertainty is implemented.
